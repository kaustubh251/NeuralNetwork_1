# NeuralNetwork_1
A 3 layer Neural Network was implemented.
The task was to identify a number between 0-9 written in 20X20 grayscale image.
Layer 1 - 400 Nodes + 1 Bias Node
Layer 2 - 100 Nodes + 1 Bias Node
Layer 3 - 10 Nodes
Parameters were randomly initialized.
Regularization was used to tackle overfitting.
Dataset Division - 75% Training Set and 25% Test Set.
